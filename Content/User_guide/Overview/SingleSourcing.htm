        <h2>Single-Sourcing</h2>
        <p>Documentation single-sourcing is the ability to re-purpose a single set of content files to publish outputs in multiple different formats, or customize the outputs for a specific audience or customer by including or excluding material as required. For example, you can use single-sourcing to create outputs in PDF, HTML, Microsoft Word, or EPUB formats from the same set of source files, all from within the Flare application. If you have special content for a specific customer or audience, you can create multiple versions of the same output that include or exclude content, down to the level of a single word, as required to meet the requirements of the intended audience. In addition, you can use single sourcing to rebrand the documents, for example in a reseller arrangement, to include different branding.</p>
        <h3>How This Template Uses Single Sourcing</h3>
        <p>This template has been designed for single-sourcing. You create a single set of content files and use TOCs and targets to output the content into a series of PDF books and a single set of HTML files that contain all of the books in the project. The single-sourcing workflow is illustrated in the following figure.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In this example, the project consists of three books, delivered to customers as individual PDFs and as a package of HTML files that contains all three books. The books have two different audiences - a standard set is delivered to most customers, while a customized set containing documentation for custom features requested by customer Y is produced for customer Y. The next release of the product will include documentation for Jira story 1 (topics 1.1.2 and 1.2.4).&#160;To facilitate reviews, an additional MSWord output is generated that contains these two topics only, for distribution to developers/testers so they can easily comment on the documentation for these new features.</p>
